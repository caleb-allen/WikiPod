    <string name="idea_for_wikipod">The idea for WikiPod came on a road trip during which I passed dozens of fascinating places.
        With no hands free I was unable to get much information while I was driving.
        WikiPod attempts to solve this problem by giving you complete access to Wikipedia using just your voice.</string>
    <string name="wikipod_reads">WikiPod is an app that lets you use Wikipedia with just your voice!</string>
    <string name="welcome_to_wikipod">Welcome to WikiPod!</string>
    <string name="nearby_what_was_that">\"Nearby / What was that\"</string>
    <string name="dictate">\"Read it\"</string>
    <string name="number">\"Any Number\"</string>
    <string name="help">\"Help\"</string>
    <string name="how_to_use">To use WikiPod, wave your hand in front of your phone\'s screen (near the speaker on top), then speak a command.
        Wave your hand again to stop WikiPod from speaking.
        \n\nYou can ask WikiPod for specific articles. For example, try saying \'Yellowstone\'.
        You can also ask WikiPod to find things near you. To do this, say \'what was that\' or \'nearby\'.
        \n\nWikiPod will sometimes display a list of options. Choose an option by clicking it, or by saying its number. You can hear all of the list options by saying \'dictate\'.
